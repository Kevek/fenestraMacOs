Fenestra
===============

Fenestra is a window manager for macOS

When activating Fenestra (default `cmd-shift-d`) you may click and drag to move and resize the focused application's frontmost window.

Activating Fenestra shows a grid selection window on each active screen, also allowing moving windows to a different screen.

Currently Fenestra supports a number of user settings:
  * Rows: Number of rows in resize selection grid
  * Columns: Number of columns in resize selection grid
  * Hotkey: The key combination that will activate the selection grid (default is `cmd-shift-d`)
  * Start at Login: Start Fenestra automatically on login
